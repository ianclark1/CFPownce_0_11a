Version 0.11a
Release Date: July 20, 2007

- Fixed some minor bugs that were causing the component to malfunction.


Version 0.1a Build 1
Release Date: July 19, 2007

This CFPownce CFC is far from being completed. Currently the only feature
it supports from the Unofficial Pownce API is getting your notes. The CFC
is very easy to use.

Instructions for use:
	1) Drop the cfpownce.cfc in your webroot or other commone area that you
	   store your CFCs for your project
	2) Init the component using the following syntax:
	
	   <cfset pownce = createObject("component","your.path.to.cfpownce").
	   init("yourPownceUsername","yourPowncePassword") />
	
	3) Once you have CFPownce instantiated, you can call the getNotes()
	   function like so:
	   
	   <cfset myNotes = pownce.getNotes() />
	   
	NOTE: The Notes are currently returned in XML
	
Being that this is the first release of CFPownce and a very quick release,
proper error handling and throwing has not been implemented yet. Meaning,
if the service is unavailble for some reason, or something else goes wrong
you will simply get a ColdFusion error on the screen for no apparent reason.
